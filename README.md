# VOICE-ASSISTANT
Personal voice assistant using python

PACKAGE ABSTRACT

TASHA - YOUR PERSONAL VOICE ASSISTANT

“OK, Google, how’s the weather today?”, “Alexa, where is the closest restaurant?”, “Hey Siri, play some music” are some of the questions that have been adapted to our daily lives. These virtual assistants have become a part of our life and home. In today’s market there are many different voice assistant platforms. These systems are still under development but quickly evolving to provide more capabilities and values to users. Development of such technologies demands vast knowledge on Cognitive Computing, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, which is beyond the scope of the project. So, this project is going to be limited to Speech Recognition 
and further manipulation of the recognized speech to perform trivial tasks handsfree.

Important modules needed:
1. speech_recognition
2. pyttsx3
3. tkinter

As mentioned earlier, one of the most important things for this project is speech recognition i.e., being able to recognize what we say/ask. For this, we need the module SpeechRecognition. Then the module pyttsx3 is useful for Text To Speech(TTS), which is needed for the program to talk back. And of course, tkinter for building a stunning GUI. Along with these modules, there are several others (like Wikipedia, Web browser, Pyjokes, BeautifulSoup) to be imported for the many different functionalities that are to be added to develop a fully functional voice assistant.

Features:
1. Basic interaction
2. Open browser and other webpages
3. Get info from Wikipedia
4. Search for movies and films
5. Play videos from YouTube
6. Play songs
7. Tell jokes
8. Calculate
9. Send emails
10. Open MS office tools
11. Update news
12. Weather report
13. Write notes, reminders, memos
14.Record voice and play recordings
15. Display notes
16. Open camera
17. Sleep, restart or shutdown
18. Exit
And much more.

Hey Tasha!
This python script will be tuned to interact with the person once they click the mic button and say “Hey Tasha”. She will respond to or greet the person and she is all theirs for them to get their job done. It’s that easy. The job can be a simple command to perform or a question to be answered and this project assures a pleasant interaction with Tasha.
